Project Name: Harmonic Bounce

Description: This game will help you practice ear training so that you can effectively discriminate between notes.

Game Mode: 1.Perfect Pitch 2.Intervals

## Perfect Pitch
In this mode, it helps practice in distinguishing the sound of each note.

Your job is to listen to the sounds that the balls in the box create. You only have three chances to answer. If they are all incorrect, you will lose. However, if you pass that level, you will be declared a winner and receive a reward.

### What you should know
From Level 2 onwards you will encounter notes marked with # or b.
These symbols denote notes that are a half-tone higher or lower.

## Intervals
In this mode there will be only two balls in the box. Your job is to listen to the sounds of these two balls and analyze the differences in sounds. To summarize, which Intervals are these two notes i?,

This game has only 3 answers: Major 3rd, Perfect 5th and Octave.

### What you should know
Interval is the distance in pitch between two notes. It can be measured by counting the number of steps between the notes on a scale, including both the starting and ending notes.

#### Major 3rd: The two notes are 4 semi tones or 2 tones apart, for example C to E is a major 3rd, because if we count another 2 tones from C, we will get D... E!!, so the answer is C to E is a major. 3rd

#### Perfect 5th: The two notes are 8 semi tones or 4 tones apart, for example C to G is a Perfect 5rd because if we count another 4 tones from C, we will get D... E ... F... G!! So the answer is C to G is a Perfect 5th.

#### Octave: In fact, an octave is one of the Perfect Intervals. Octaves are the same sound just in different octaves. For example, if you hear a low C and a high C, you can immediately tell that it is an Octave.

## Hint.

If you can't figure it out, try observing the difference in sounds. If you feel that the two tones are slightly different, It can be assumed that this pair is Major 3rd if you feel that the difference is greater. You can answer that it's Perfect 5th. And if you feel that the sound has very different highs and lows, you can answer that it's Octave.
